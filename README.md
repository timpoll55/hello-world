An Intro to Repositories
This readme is designed to give a general overview of repository.  This repository is for me to familiarize myself with GitHub and learn a bit more about how it works.  I am searching for places to put my data science portfolio and I've read that GitHub is a good place to start.  Hopefully this introductory work will give me a sense of where I am headed with everything.
